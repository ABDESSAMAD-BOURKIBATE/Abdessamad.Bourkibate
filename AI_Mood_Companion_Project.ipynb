        "This project aims to develop an interactive application operating within the Google Colab environment, powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The program analyzes the user's emotional state based on their text input, logs all mood entries in a dedicated database, and generates insightful statistical visualizations, enabling users to track their psychological well-being over time.\n",
        "The app also provides simple emotional support through encouraging responses and recommendations when needed, as well as visual charts displaying mood history and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Project Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Accept and analyze user input text for sentiment assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify the type of emotion (positive, negative, etc.) and display confidence scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Save all entries in a CSV log to enable long-term mood tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generate visual charts to show mood distribution and evolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Easy to set up and run on Google Colab, with all dependencies handled automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Target Audience:\n",
        "\n",
        "Anyone interested in tracking, analyzing, and understanding their emotional state.\n",

        "Interact with the chatbot by typing feelings, receiving encouragement and analysis.\n",
